This WordPress plugin allows you to show the user how long it will take to read the article considering the speed in which the user is scrolling.

== Description ==
A pluginized version of ReadRemaining.js

Tell your readers how long they'll need to get through all of your gibberish, with this clever jQuery plugin. With WP ReadRemaining TL;DR is a thing of the past.

Personalized - The time is estimated based on the user scrolling speed
Non-Annoying - It is set to appear only when the user is actually reading.           
Fully customizable - Bold Comic Sans? No problem, just set the css. But... why?          
Flexible layout - Takes into account text, images or even videos.
